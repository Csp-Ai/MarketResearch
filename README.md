> Turn any company website into a market research blueprint in minutes â€” powered by AI agents.  
> Deploy an agent team that crawls your site, mines content, and produces an AI-ready go-to-market blueprint.

## Why This Matters (SEI lens)
- **Decision velocity**: quickly surface market positioning and operational gaps.
- **Portfolio prioritization**: compare offerings and focus investment where data proves demand.
- **Lower research cost**: automate first-pass discovery and keep consultants on higher-value analysis.
- **Ops readiness**: blueprint outputs feed change-management checklists and risk registers.
- **Client impact**: provides SEI consultants with a ready-made first-pass view, accelerating due diligence, strategy assessments, and transformation roadmaps.

## Live Demo Flow
1. Enter a company URL and click **Deploy Agent Team**
2. **URL Scout** maps the site
3. **Page Selector** focuses high-value pages
4. **Content Miner** extracts copy
5. **Strategy Builder** assembles the AI Market Research Blueprint
6. Live agent feed logs progress and results
7. Download or share the Blueprint

> This mirrors how SEI teams accelerate discovery, reduce prep time, and focus consultants on high-value advisory work.
