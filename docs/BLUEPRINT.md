# Blueprint

Guidelines for maintaining the Market Research Blueprint documentation.

## Review Requirements

- Every update requires review and approval from at least one project maintainer.
- Pull requests must describe the motivation for the change and summarize the updates.
- Self-merging without review is prohibited unless a maintainer grants explicit permission.

## Citation Requirements

- Support factual statements with citations to source material.
- Reference repository files using the format `path/to/file:line-start-line-end`.
- Include snippets of command output when citing terminal commands or tests.
